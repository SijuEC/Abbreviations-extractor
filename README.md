# Abbreviations extractor
 Extract abbreviations from a text file


### How to use this tool

 1: Clone this repository onto your system.
 
 2: Save your document into the same folder as this python program as a ".txt" file named "file.txt".
 
 3: Open the "abbreviations_extractor.py" file with jupyter notebooks.

 This program will create an excel file called "abr_list.xlsx" along with all words in the document that have consecutive capital letters.
 
 I created this program in a few minutes to solve the problem of finding all abbreviations in my report to create a "List of Abbreviations". Therefore you can feel free to tailor this snippet of code to your liking to reduce your list even further and make it even more managable.
